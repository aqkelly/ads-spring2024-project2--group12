## Project 2 Shiny App
Term: Fall 2023

+ Team # 12
+ **Projec title**: + Disaster Declarations Summaries
	+ Jiaqi Lu
	+ Yuqi Liu
	+ Guanbiao Li
	+ Tianyi Jiang

+ **Shiny App Link**: https://dataevan.shinyapps.io/Shinyapp-12/
	
+ **Project summary**: We aim to develop a mobile application specifically designed for government agencies, enabling them to summarize and analyze historical disaster data swiftly. This application will facilitate these agencies in conducting comprehensive analyses of past disasters, which, in turn, will inform their decision-making processes regarding funding allocations and budgeting strategies. By leveraging this data, the government can make more informed decisions, optimize the allocation of resources to areas most in need, and improve disaster response and preparedness strategies.
